# Hall-B-classification
## Classifies image data to detect real and simulated image data


  1. **vector_2.py (This is a implementation of the regular vector.py file with dfferenet paraemeter.Overall it was fruitless)
  
  2. **vector_3.py* (This was a scratch made vgg-16 CNN that had up to two maxpooling layers, results proves about the same as        
                   **the regular vecor.py)
                  
  3. **vector_4.py (this is a modify version of the original vector file where it crates a checkpoint per epoch)
